# Front End Application for KBE Microservices

This is the front end application that acts as a GUI that user / customer can interact with. The front end is designed to look as if it's a online shop. The front end is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). No unit test is provided as this project is just a graphical representation of the whole micro service. The application is hosted on Github Page and the deployment process is done automatically via Github Actions.
